#To open the file, use the built-in open() function.
#The open() function returns a file object, which has a read() method for reading the content of the file:
f = open("demofile.txt")
print(f.read())

#If the file is located in a different location, you will have to specify the file path, like this:
f = open("D:\\myfiles\welcome.txt")
print(f.read())

#You can also use the with statement when opening a file:
#Then you do not have to worry about closing your files, the with statement takes care of that.
with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  print(f.read())

#Close Files
#It is a good practice to always close the file when you are done with it.
#If you are not using the with statement, you must write a close statement in order to close the file:
f = open("demofile.txt")
print(f.readline())
f.close()
#Note: You should always close your files. In some cases, due to buffering, changes made to a file may not show until you close the file.

#Read Only Parts of the File
#By default the read() method returns the whole text, but you can also specify how many characters you want to return:
with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  print(f.read(5))

#Read Lines
#You can return one line by using the readline() method:
with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  print(f.readline())

#By calling readline() two times, you can read the two first lines:
with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  print(f.readline())
  print(f.readline())
  
#By looping through the lines of the file, you can read the whole file, line by line:
with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  for x in f:
    print(x)
