#To write to an existing file, you must add a parameter to the open() function:
#"a" - Append - will append to the end of the file
#"w" - Write - will overwrite any existing content
#Open the file "demofile.txt" and append content to the file:
with open("demofile.txt", "a") as f:
  f.write("Now the file has more content!")
with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  print(f.read())

#To overwrite the existing content to the file, use the w parameter:
#Open the file "demofile.txt" and overwrite the content:
with open("demofile.txt", "w") as f:
  f.write("Woops! I have deleted the content!")

with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  print(f.read())
#Note: the "w" method will overwrite the entire file.

#To create a new file in Python, use the open() method, with one of the following parameters:
#"x" - Create - will create a file, returns an error if the file exists
#"a" - Append - will create a file if the specified file does not exists
#"w" - Write - will create a file if the specified file does not exists
#Create a new file called "myfile.txt":
f = open("myfile.txt", "x")
